This Java code defines a simple chatbot that simulates a conversation with users. The chatbot responds to user inputs, providing information and guidance related to Amazon, including product inquiries, order tracking, delivery information, payment issues, and returns. The chatbot uses a basic rule-based approach to generate responses based on keywords detected in the user's input. The conversation continues until the user types "exit" to end the chat.

This code implements a simple chatbot for Amazon customer service inquiries. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

User Interaction: It utilizes the Scanner class to accept user input through the console.
Conversation Loop: The program runs in a loop, prompting the user for input ("You: ") and processing their queries until the user types "exit".
Keyword Matching: The getResponse method analyzes the user's input (converted to lowercase) for specific keywords related to Amazon services.
Response Generation: Based on the identified keywords, the method provides pre-defined informative responses directing users to the Amazon website or customer service for further assistance.
Random Responses for Unrecognized Input: If no keywords are matched, the method randomly selects a response from an array expressing confusion or offering general help.
