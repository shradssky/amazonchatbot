# amazonchatbot
This Java code builds a basic Amazon chatbot! It chats with users, answering questions about products, orders, deliveries, payments, and returns. It uses keywords to understand your needs.  "Headphones" might lead to product info, "track order" could show your package location, and so on. The conversation ends when you type "exit."
